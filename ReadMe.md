# Intel T265 wrapper
This wrapper is to help to simplify your interaction with T265. The camera will be automatically initialized and closed.

This is very minimalistic. The point is to provide the simplest possible way of using T265 cameras. 

## Important Note
Starting [Ver. 1.54.1](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases/tag/v2.54.1) Intel has dropped supports for T265 entirely. 
Hence, this library requires pyrealsense2 earlier than Ver. 2.53.1 
Starting Ver 0.1.3 this is part of requirements.txt.

## Installation
this library is pip installable
```bash
pip install t265
```
